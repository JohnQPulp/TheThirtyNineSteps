  "blurb": "<i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i> is a historical thriller. \"Historical\" in the sense that it's set one year before the year it was published, which is more consequential than it sounds, arguably the more interesting aspect of the book than its \"thriller\" plotting.\nIt's a thoroughly readable book.",
  "blurb2": "This book really gets you revved up for killing those damn krauts. And if you get to complaining about the book's sloppy prose or nonsensical plotting, it's probably just because you're one of those damn krauts yourself."
