  "blurb": "<i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i> is a book that really gets you revved up for killing those damn krauts. And if you get to complaining about the book's sloppy prose or nonsensical plotting, it's probably just because you're one of those damn krauts yourself.\n(This blurb may be unhelpful, but at least it doesn't contain <b>major spoilers</b> like every other blurb for the book does.)"
